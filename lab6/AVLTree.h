 *
 *      AVLTree is a class that begins as an empty AVL Tree representation and 
 *      allows for the insertion of int values. Clients can also print a visual 
 *      representation of the AVL Tree. 
 * 
 *      Note: Balancing functions must be implemented by students to get an 
 *            accurate AVL tree representation.
