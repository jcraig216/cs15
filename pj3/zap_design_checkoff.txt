Unlike the previous two projects, there is no design checkoff for this one. You do not 
have to submit these questions on Gradescope and you do not have to meet with a TA. 

These questions are provided to you to help guide you in the implementation process. 
If you would like to discuss any of these questions with a TA in office hours or on 
Piazza, feel free to do so. 

That being said, we strongly recommend looking through these questions and coming up 
with rough answers before working on phase 2.

1. Are you comfortable with a preorder traversal? Write out the pseudocode. Explain
what it does. Where in the assignment do you think you will use it? 

Answer: 

2. Do you understand the differences between passing by reference versus by value? What does
   this code print? Why do you think this relates to zap? 

   void func1(int x) {
       x = 1; 
   }

   void func2(int &x) {
       x = 2;
   }

   int main() {
       int y = 0;
       func1(y); 
       cout << y << endl; 
       func2(y); 
       cout << y << endl;   
       return 0;
   }

Answer: 

3. How do you plan to count characters? 

Answer: 

4. What data structure will you use for tree building? Do you understand how it works? Explain how it works in 
   1-2 sentences. 

Answer: 

5. If you are iterating from root to leaf and then restart from the root, do you think you should do that iteratively 
or recursively? Which part of the assignment is this eluding to?

Answer: 

6. What will your member variables be? What will your destructor have to do? 

Answer: 

7. Do you think there's any reason to implement a tree freeing function for phase 1? (Hint: think about testing)

Answer: 

8. How do you plan to test your program? What evidence of testing do you plan to submit? (Hint: use ZapUtil.h!)

Answer: 
     
9. What is your timeline for completing this project? What would you like to have completed, and by which dates?
